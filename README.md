Hello, welcome to my very first project!
In this project, I created a game called "Get Out of the Paper!" using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project was inspired by multiple platform-style games such as Mario and Castlevania.

The art style was created by me, taking inspiration from stickman models found in various animations from the early days of stickman animation.

The main objective of Get Out of the Paper! is, as the name implies, to escape the paper. To achieve this, you must reach the exit before the timer runs out.

Of course, it will not be an easy journey! That’s where the ink monsters come in — they will do everything they can to make you fail your mission.

This is also where the power-ups play their role. Power-ups give your character a special ability that allows you to reset the positions of the ink monsters. But be careful — using them can make the game more challenging, so use them wisely!

Get Out of the Paper! was designed to be played using either the arrow keys or WASD, providing an intuitive experience for players.
